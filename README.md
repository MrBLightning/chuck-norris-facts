## *How to run this app*

### Make sure you have the right environment

Before choosing to work or run this code make sure you have the right tools.\
I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\
If you do not have VSC or some other code editing program I'd recommend\
downlowding one before you start.

### Download the code

You can download the app's code by clicking on the 'code' button\
on the top right of the repository screen and choosing the `Download ZIP` option.

This will get you a zip (compressed) file containing almost\
all the files you need to run this app locally.

Once your download is done you can unzip the code\
(open the compressed file) into a folder of your choice.

### Install needed libraries

To get all the needed libraries to run this code please make sure you are\
in the project directory and run the command `npm i` in VSC's terminal.

In order to start the app you can run `npm start` in VSC's terminal.\
This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits to the code.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
